  summary: Richard hails from Tulsa. He has earned degrees from the University of
    Oklahoma and Stanford. (Go Sooners and Cardinals!) Before starting Pied Piper,
    he worked for Hooli as a part time software developer. While his work focuses
    on applied information theory, mostly optimizing lossless compression schema of
    both the length-limited and adaptive variants, his non-work interests range widely,
    everything from quantum computing to chaos theory. He could tell you about it,
    but THAT would NOT be a length-limited conversation!
